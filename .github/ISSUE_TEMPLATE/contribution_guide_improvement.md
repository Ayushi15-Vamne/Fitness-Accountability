Contribution guide improvement

Help us improve the contributor guide for future users (such as giving feedback on the complexity or the cross compatibility of the guide)

In your report, please include as much of the following details as possible

 - What topic is it related around? `cross compatibility` or `complexity` or `others`
 - What is the spesific thing you would like to fix/change/improve on (please try to explain as thoroughly as possible, maybe even include some screenshots)
 - How might this help improve the guide?
 - Any other suggestions? (such as changing the layout of the report template)
 - Would you want to see the suggestions on the guide ASAP? `yes` or `no`

Thanks!
