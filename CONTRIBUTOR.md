##### Note that this file walks you through using Github Desktop + Visual Studio Code

### Objectives

The main objective of this file is a walkthrough of how to setup and run this application locally and is for maintainers and contributors alike! If at any point anything becomes unclear, please create an issue with which steps are confusing and tag `win21H2`.

### Methodology

  - Clone this github repository and open it in Github Desktop
  - Open the repository in Visual Studio Code using Github Desktop
  - Make a new branch
  - Commit to that branch and via Github Desktop, create a pull request

### Tools

<a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Desktop</a><br>
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>

### Quick access index

`the quick access index links are not working`

#### Step 1 - Clone and open in Visual Studio Code

Firstly, you want to head over to the green `code` button. Next, you will have to go to the `HTTPS` section and copy the URL which is provided (you can click the small copy icon to the right of the link).<br>

Now go ahead and open up Github Desktop and click `File` and then `Clone repository...`, you should then see a `Clone repository` window pop up, go to the `URL` section on the top menu and paste the link in the `URL or username/repository` section. After that, click `Clone`<br>

You should then see something like the below

Which means you have cloned the repository to your local computer. After that, go ahead an click on the `Fetch origin` button around the top right and after it fetches, click on the button on the top that says `Current branch` and click `New branch` and name your branch. An example is `win21H2-card`<br>

Go ahead and click the `Create branch` button and then `Publish branch`.<br>

At this point, do not click `Create Pull Request` because you have not added anything and there is no point making a pull request with nothing in it. Now, click the `Open in Visual Studio Code` button.<br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92825997/183300703-4bb2a869-d471-412f-b0f3-54e15ee8128e.png)<br>

Note that the editor you use does not have to be Visual Studio Code and if you would like to change it, there is a link `Options`, click on that and change the editor to the one you want to use.

#### Step 2 - Run the NextJS application

#### Step 3 - Exit/kill the application

#### Step 4 - Commit the changes to your branch

#### Step 5 - Push and create a pull request

#### Step 6 - Celebrate!
